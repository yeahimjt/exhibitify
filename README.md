# Exhibitify

Establish your identity on the internet

## Introduction
Exhibitify is a full stack web application that utilizes technologies like Next.js, React.js, Tailwind, Firebase, Zustand, Puppeteer and NextAuth. The primary use case for Exhibitify is for users to, without pesky restrictions, upload their web portfolio for viewing and feedback. This has the potential to allow the users to create a brand from their portfolio. Other general users browsing Exhibitify will have a large database to finding real-world web portfolios rather than being fed the same frequent portfolios that are often found at top google searches.

## Functionality
Puppeteer is importantly used when a user is creating a post. Its functionality is important because it allows users to not have worry about screenshotting and uploading their screenshot, Exhbitify will take their URL they provide and navigate to it, waiting a few seconds to allow any loading animations to finish and screenshot their portfolio for them. This also allows for all images uploaded to Exhibitify to share the same resolution to avoid poor quality pictures enhancing general users experience on the website.

Zustand is another important aspect to Exhibitfy, it is used for state management allowing users to perform functionality such as, changing and remembering user theme, and liking posts.

## Purpose
The projected was created to take over the top google search results for 'software engineering portfolios, web portfolios' and other similar search queries. Personally, I have searched these queries several times when developing a new web portfolio for myself. I have always been dissatisied from the top results being the same blog posts that re-use a lot of similar portfolios that many of other developers creating a personal web portfolio have seen. Exhibitify is meant to tackle that scenario by providing the users a platform to indefinitely search and simply view images of other portfolios for inspiration.

## Challenges Faced
Having utilized the technologies used for this project I did not have any significant problems faced.
